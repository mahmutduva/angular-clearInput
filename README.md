# Angular Clear Input Directive

An AngularJS directive for adding a clear button inside an input element

How to use angular-clearInput
Just include angular-clearInput.js after angularJs (jQuery is not required). 
Then you will need to make sure that you have mdClearInput in your app module. That's it!

```
<input type="text" ng-model=“name" md-clear-input>
```

```
<textarea ng-model=“message" md-clear-input></textarea>
```
